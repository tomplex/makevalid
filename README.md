## makevalid

Simple tool to "makevalid" files containing WKT geometries.

## build and install

Requires GEOS >= 3.8 & `cmake` >= 3.13. The standard system locations
will be searched for GEOS. Please note that the build will not try all 
possible GEOS installations but just the first found by `cmake`. If that version
is not >=3.8, you will have to specify the path to your installation explicitly. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tomplex/makevalid.git
cd makevalid

# optionally specify location of GEOS library.
# /usr/ and /usr/local will be searched by default.
cmake -DGEOS_DIR=/usr/local/geos/3.8.1/ . && make
```

This will create an executable called `makevalid` in your local directory. 

If you explictly specify a directory, it should be the root install directory for geos, such that 
the directory contains the GEOS `bin`, `include`, and `lib` directories, like so:

```bash
‚ùØ ll /usr/local/geos/3.8.1/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel  160 Apr  8 17:56 .
drwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel  128 Apr 21 00:27 ..
drwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel   96 Apr  8 17:56 bin
drwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel  160 Apr  8 17:56 include
drwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel  320 Apr  8 17:56 lib
```

This directory is equivalent to the `--prefix` used when installing GEOS from source.

If you are on Linux/MacOS, you can install GEOS from source like so, assuming `wget` 
is installed. You should be able to use `curl` interchangeably.

```bash
pushd /tmp
wget http://download.osgeo.org/geos/geos-3.8.1.tar.bz2

tar -xf geos-3.8.1.tar.bz2
pushd geos-3.8.1/
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/geos/3.8.1
make -j 4 
sudo make install
popd; popd
```

This will install GEOS from source in the directory `/usr/local/geos/3.8.1`. You can then run the install commands for makevalid
above, verbatim.
